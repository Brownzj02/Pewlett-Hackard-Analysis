# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to assist Pewlett-Hackard in taking CSV files from excel converting them over to SQL database. Within that, we are also to sort out the number of employees nearing retirement age within the company and employees that have mentorship eligibility.--

## Results
Four major takeaways of this analysis include:

- Roughly 30% of workforce will be lost (300,024 current employees and 90,398 nearing retirement).

- Production and Development departments will experience the most loss.

- Only two managers are in the retirement category, but the company has thousands of senior level staff and engineers they will be losing. This can be critical to their company's operations as employees begin to retire and ensuring their roles are filled and the responsiveness to the possible impact of lost expertise.

- The company should put greater emphasis on their mentorship program for the number of team members lost. For the number of senior level team members that will be transitioning out, lower level team members need to be prepared for those roles.--
## Summary
- 90398 roles will need to be filled for the Silver Tsunami. Within that figure only about 1500 employees are eligible for the mentorship program. The two managers don't even appear to be in this pool. They should probably change their guidelines as to who can participate in the program. Age should not be the only factor as their could be younger employees that perform just as well if not better their older peers. There could also be employees who may not be as tenured within the company, but can bring valuble skills and training to the program.
